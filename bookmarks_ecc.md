People are wrong on the internet, exchibit 2147483647.

"Schneier recommends TrueCrypt / cipher cascades".

"Schneier recommends gpg".

"Schneier recommends people stay away from NISP P curves or all ECC altogether because it's backdoored by the NSA".

"DJB said NIST P Curves are backdoored".

What I think:

I recommend people don't listen to Schneier, use minisign and age, don't use gpg.

NIST P-256 ECDH and ECDSA are fine, but prefer X25519 and Ed25519.

DJB said that Brainpool are not really better than the NIST curves and a method based on pure math should be used.

DUAL_EC_DRBG is not the NIST P curves or all ECC cryptography.

I don't know about VeraCrypt.

Thomas Ptacek being wrong about DUAL_EC_DRBG because it looked too obvious like a backdoor to be the real NSA backdoor:
