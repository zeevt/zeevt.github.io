ARM [Cortex-M0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M#Cortex-M0+) microcontrollers
are powered by a 32 bit ARMv6 architecture CPU, 2 stages,
in order execution, no speculation, no branch prediction (IIRC).

[BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/) is a TLS stack for such chips by Thomas Pornin,
a person who realy knows what he's doing with TLS -
the BearSSL site, code and his answers on [crypto.SE](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/28/thomas-pornin)
and [security.SE](https://security.stackexchange.com/users/655/thomas-pornin) are an education.

[The microcontrollers go into USB cables](http://www.cypress.com/products/ez-pd-ccg2-type-c-port-controller).
Yes, the cable itself, not the host USB controller.
