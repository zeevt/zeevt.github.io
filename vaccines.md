My opinion in vaccines:

- Some children are at an age when they are both too young to get vaccinated and too old to be protected by antibodies from their mother. They rely on herd immunity to not get infected.
- Vaccinations don't always take, so some people who have been vaccinated are not immune and rely on herd immunity to not get infected.
- Some people are immunocompromised and cannot take vaccinations and rely on herd immunity to not get infected.
- The risk is something on the order of 1 child per million dies (or gets a lasting severe outcome, IIRC). That's ~4 children per year in the US, traded for the lives of millions.
