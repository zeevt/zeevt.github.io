[Lois McMaster Bujold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_McMaster_Bujold)
is a very successful Science Fiction and Fantasy author.

Some SciFi awards (and nominations) give out tie pins the author can wear
to proudly announce how successful he is. Lois couldn't wear them in the way
they were intended, so she had a necklace made with all her awards.
