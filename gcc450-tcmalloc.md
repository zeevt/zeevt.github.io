When I was younger and stupider, I used to think everyone who worked at Google was like Jeff Dean.

Then, GCC-4.5.0 miscompiled tcmalloc (and hence, chrome) on my gentoo,
I reported the bug to Google and the maintainer [wrote](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/issues/239#issuecomment-133757425):

I thought any C programmer should be able to read the assembly generated by the compiler for their own code.

I stil think that.

Anyway, I've found the exact source line that was miscompiled,
and eventually the issue boiled down to
"you have to use `-fno-builtin-malloc -fno-builtin-calloc` if you override malloc", which is sensible.

That day I learned that some of the tens of thousands of engineers who work at Google are not supermen.
