I believe that MySQL is the PHP of relational databases:
You can do most things with it, but you don't choose it when you have the option to choose something better.

A piece of software that makes MySQL (and MariaDB) much more useful,
but for some stupid reason is not shipped with MySQL or MariaDB,
is [pt-online-schema-change](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html).

I believe using MySQL without it is silly or a professional malpractice,
depending on context.
