There used to be a time when semiconductor fab lithography process nodes (generations)
were called after the smallest feature size, like 0.18Î¼m/180nm, 65nm, 28nm.

But 22nm was not called for any feature size, it was just a marketing name
for a more advanced process than 28nm. Since then, lithography process
advancement has occurred and transistor density has increased, but the names
have a been a lie, and you cannot compare processes with the same name across
companies.

This is an egregious example of marketers using the fact that updating
information in people's heads is very hard (achieving 100% update reach and stickiness is impossible)
for nefarious purposes. If there was justice in the world, IEEE police
would execute the people responsible using [chlorine trifluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_trifluoride) or
by an [EUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography) tool.

Anyway, see [7nm](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/7_nm_lithography_process)
and [5nm](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/5_nm_lithography_process).
