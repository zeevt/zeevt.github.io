The huge advantage of the metric system is not in its different choice of 1 unit of length, 1 unit of mass, etc. but in the relationships between all units.

Using the American customary system of measurements is like using Roman numerals - everything is possible, but harder.

Robert Zubrin mentioned how when Lockheed bought Martin Marietta, they forced them to convert from metric back to freedom units.
